## ðŸ“Œ Overview

![image-20241001125640288](https://s2.loli.net/2024/10/01/5loipZJdOrtVS3Q.png)

**TL;DR:** We introduce a new data augmentation method for tabular data, which is fast, requires no additional training, and can be applied to any downstream predictors model.

**Abstract:** Data collection is often difficult in critical fields such as medicine, physics, and chemistry. As a result, classification methods usually perform poorly with these small datasets, leading to weak predictive performance. Increasing the training set with additional synthetic data, similar to data augmentation in images, is commonly believed to improve downstream classification performance. However, current tabular generative methods that learn either the joint distribution p(x,y) p(\mathbf{x}, y) or the class-conditional distribution p(xâˆ£y) p(\mathbf{x} \mid y) often overfit on small datasets, resulting in poor-quality synthetic data, usually worsening classification performance compared to using real data alone. To solve these challenges, we introduce TabEBM, a novel class-conditional generative method using Energy-Based Models (EBMs). Unlike existing methods that use a shared model to approximate all class-conditional densities, our key innovation is to create distinct EBM generative models for each class, each modelling its class-specific data distribution individually. This approach creates robust energy landscapes, even in ambiguous class distributions. Our experiments show that TabEBM generates synthetic data with higher quality and better statistical fidelity than existing methods. When used for data augmentation, our synthetic data consistently improves the classification performance across diverse datasets of various sizes, especially small ones.

# ðŸ’¥ Running Experiments with TabEBM

- [![Test In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/andreimargeloiu/TabEBM/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial1_generate_data.ipynb) [Tutorial 1: Generate synthetic data with TabEBM](https://github.com/andreimargeloiu/TabEBM/blob/main/tutorials/tutorial1_generate_data.ipynb)

  - The library can generate synthetic data with three lines of code.

    ```python
    from tabebm.TabEBM import TabEBM

    tabebm = TabEBM()
    augmented_data = tabebm.generate(X_train, y_train, num_samples=100)

    # Output:
    # augmented_data[class_id] = numpy.ndarray of generated data for a specific â€™â€™class_idâ€˜â€˜
    ```

  - The library allows computation of TabEBMâ€™s energy function and the unnormalised data density.

    ```python
    from tabebm.TabEBM import plot_TabEBM_energy_contour

    X, y = circles_dataset(n_samples=300, noise=2)
    plot_tabebm_probabilities(X, y, title_prefix='(noise=2)', h=0.2)
    plt.show()
    ```
